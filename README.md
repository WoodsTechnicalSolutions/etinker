Embedded Tinkerer Sandbox

This is a basic embedded software sandbox that can be used to experiment with some of the essential open source components used in low-level development. Generating production quality software BSP images is **NOT** a goal here. Gaining some understanding of how things are really built, or can be built, is the purpose behind the work. As the name suggests, this is about tinkering.
