Embedded Tinkerer Sandbox

This is a basic embedded software sandbox that can be used to experiment
with some of the essential open source components used in low-level
development. Generating production quality software BSP images is
**NOT** a goal here. Gaining some understanding of how things are really
built, or can be built, is the purpose behind the work. As the name
suggests, this is about tinkering.
